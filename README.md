# Pong

In this simple terminal game, I recreate the classic Atari game: Pong. Get a friend and start playing together.

## Installation

You'll need:

- Python 3
- A Linux server

Go to your folder with the files and run 

```
python pong.py
```

It will first ask for the players name. Then, just have fun.
